<h1>Sorting Algorithms Visualization</h1>
<h4>A sorting algorithm is a set of instructions given to a computer to sort in a certain way a list of numbers, it also can sort anything that have any countable way
i.e. a list of words can be sorted in lexicographical order. In this representation, all the numbers that we sort, are representated as vertical rectangles, and the numbers
are randomly generated.</h4>
